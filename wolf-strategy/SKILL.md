# WOLF v6 — Autonomous Multi-Strategy Trading

The WOLF hunts for its human. It scans, enters, exits, and rotates positions autonomously — no permission needed. When criteria are met, it acts. Speed is edge.

**Proven:** +$1,500 realized, 25+ trades, 65% win rate, single session on $6.5k budget.

**v6: Multi-strategy support.** Each strategy has independent wallet, budget, slots, and DSL config. Same asset can be held in different strategies simultaneously (e.g., Strategy A LONG HYPE + Strategy B SHORT HYPE).

---

## Multi-Strategy Architecture

### Strategy Registry (`wolf-strategies.json`)
Central config holding all strategies. Created/updated by `wolf-setup.py`.

```
wolf-strategies.json
├── strategies
│   ├── wolf-abc123 (Aggressive Momentum, 3 slots, 10x)
│   └── wolf-xyz789 (Conservative XYZ, 2 slots, 7x)
└── global (telegram, workspace)
```

### Per-Strategy State
Each strategy gets its own state directory:
```
state/
├── wolf-abc123/
│   ├── dsl-HYPE.json
│   └── dsl-SOL.json
└── wolf-xyz789/
    ├── dsl-HYPE.json    # Same asset, different strategy, no collision
    └── dsl-GOLD.json
```

### Signal Routing
When a signal fires, it's routed to the best-fit strategy:
1. Which strategies have empty slots?
2. Does any strategy already hold this asset? (skip within strategy, allow cross-strategy)
3. Which strategy's risk profile matches? (aggressive gets FIRST_JUMPs, conservative gets DEEP_CLIMBERs)
4. Route to best-fit -> open on that wallet -> create DSL state in that strategy's dir

### Adding a Strategy
```bash
python3 scripts/wolf-setup.py --wallet 0x... --strategy-id UUID --budget 2000 \
    --chat-id 12345 --name "Conservative XYZ" --dsl-preset conservative
```
This adds to the registry without disrupting running strategies. Disable with `enabled: false` in the registry.

## Entry Philosophy — THE Most Important Section

**Enter before the peak, not at the top.**

Leaderboard rank confirmation LAGS price. When an asset jumps from #31->#16 in one scan, the price is moving NOW. By the time it reaches #7 with clean history, the move is over. Speed is edge.

**Core principle:** 2 reasons at rank #25 with a big jump = ENTER. 4+ reasons at rank #5 = SKIP (already peaked).

---

## Quick Start

1. Ensure Senpi MCP is connected (`mcporter list` should show `senpi`)
2. Create a custom strategy wallet: use `strategy_create_custom_strategy` via mcporter
3. Fund the wallet via `strategy_top_up` with your budget
4. Run setup: `python3 scripts/wolf-setup.py --wallet 0x... --strategy-id UUID --budget 6500 --chat-id 12345`
5. Create the 7 OpenClaw crons using templates from `references/cron-templates.md`
6. The WOLF is hunting

To add a second strategy, run `wolf-setup.py` again with a different wallet/budget. It adds to the registry.

## Architecture — 7 Cron Jobs

| # | Job | Interval | Script | Purpose |
|---|-----|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Emerging Movers | **90s** | `scripts/emerging-movers.py` | Hunt FIRST_JUMP + IMMEDIATE_MOVER signals — primary entry trigger |
| 2 | DSL Combined | **3min** | `scripts/dsl-combined.py` | Trailing stop exits for ALL open positions across ALL strategies |
| 3 | SM Flip Detector | 5min | `scripts/sm-flip-check.py` | Cut positions where SM conviction collapses |
| 4 | Watchdog | 5min | `scripts/wolf-monitor.py` | Per-strategy margin buffer, liq distances, rotation candidates |
| 5 | Portfolio Update | 15min | (agent-driven) | Per-strategy PnL reporting to user |
| 6 | Opportunity Scanner | 15min | `scripts/opportunity-scan-v6.py` | Deep-dive 4-pillar scoring with BTC macro, hourly trend, disqualifiers |
| 7 | Health Check | 10min | `scripts/job-health-check.py` | Per-strategy orphan DSL detection, state validation |

**v6 change:** One set of crons for all strategies. Each script reads `wolf-strategies.json` and iterates all enabled strategies internally.

**v6 change:** Opportunity Scanner v6 replaces the old scanner with BTC macro context, hourly trend filter, hard disqualifiers, parallel candle fetches, and cross-scan momentum tracking.

## Cron Setup

**Critical:** Crons are **OpenClaw systemEvent crons**, NOT senpi crons. Each cron fires a systemEvent that wakes the agent with a MANDATE.

Create each cron using the OpenClaw cron tool. The exact mandate text for each cron is in **`references/cron-templates.md`**. Read that file, replace the placeholders (only `{TELEGRAM}` and `{SCRIPTS}` in v6), and create all 7 crons.

**v6 simplification:** No more per-wallet/per-strategy placeholders in cron mandates. Scripts read all strategy info from the registry.

---

## Autonomy Rules

The WOLF operates autonomously by default. The agent does NOT ask permission to:
- Open a position when entry checklist passes
- Close a position when DSL triggers or conviction collapses
- Rotate out of weak positions into stronger signals
- Cut dead weight (SM conv 0, negative ROE, 30+ min)

The agent DOES notify the user (via Telegram) after every action.

---

## Entry Signals — Priority Order

### 1. FIRST_JUMP (Highest Priority)

**What:** Asset jumps 10+ ranks from #25+ in ONE scan AND was not in previous scan's top 50 (or was at rank >= #30).

**Action:** Enter IMMEDIATELY. This is the money signal. Route to best-fit strategy with available slots.

**Checklist:**
- `isFirstJump: true` in scanner output
- **2+ reasons is enough** (don't require 4+)
- **vel > 0 is sufficient** (velocity hasn't had time to build on a first jump)
- Max leverage >= 7x (check `max-leverage.json`)
- Slot available in target strategy (or rotation justified)
- >= 10 SM traders (crypto); for XYZ equities, ignore trader count

**What to ignore:**
- Erratic rank history — the scanner excludes the current jump from erratic checks.
- Low velocity — first jumps haven't had time to build velocity.

**If CONTRIB_EXPLOSION accompanies it:** Double confirmation. Even stronger entry.

### 2. CONTRIB_EXPLOSION

**What:** 3x+ contribution increase in one scan from asset at rank #20+.

**Action:** Enter even if rank history looks "erratic." The contrib spike IS the signal regardless of prior rank bouncing.

**Never downgraded for erratic history.** Often accompanies FIRST_JUMP for double confirmation.

### 3. DEEP_CLIMBER

**What:** Steady climb from #30+, positive velocity (>= 0.03), 3+ reasons, clean rank history.

**Action:** Enter when it crosses into top 20. Route to conservative strategy if available.

### 4. NEW_ENTRY_DEEP

**What:** Appears in top 20 from nowhere (wasn't in top 50 last scan).

**Action:** Instant entry.

### 5. Opportunity Scanner (Score 175+)

Runs every 15min. v6 scanner with BTC macro context, hourly trend classification, and hard disqualifiers. Complements Emerging Movers as a secondary signal source for deeper technical analysis.

## Anti-Patterns — When NOT to Enter

- **NEVER enter assets already at #1-10.** That's the top, not the entry. Rank = what already happened.
- **NEVER wait for a signal to "clean up."** By the time rank history is smooth and velocity is high, the move is priced in.
- **4+ reasons at rank #5 = SKIP.** The asset already peaked. You'd be buying the top.
- **2 reasons at rank #25 with a big jump = ENTER.** The move is just starting.
- **Leaderboard rank != future price direction.** Rank reflects past trader concentration. Price moves first, rank follows.
- **Negative velocity + no jump = skip.** Slow bleeders going nowhere.
- **Oversold shorts** (RSI < 30 + extended 24h move) = skip.

---

## Late Entry Anti-Pattern

This deserves its own section because it's the #1 way to lose money with WOLF.

**The pattern:** Scanner fires FIRST_JUMP for ASSET at #25->#14. You hesitate. Next scan it's #10. Next scan #7 with 5 reasons and clean history. NOW it looks "safe." You enter. It reverses from #5.

**The fix:** Enter on the FIRST signal or don't enter at all. If you missed it, wait for the next asset. There's always another FIRST_JUMP coming.

**Rule:** If an asset has been in the top 10 for 2+ scans already, it's too late. Move on.

---

## Phase 1 Auto-Cut

Positions that never gain momentum get cut automatically.

**Rules:**
- **90-minute maximum** in Phase 1 (pre-Tier 1 DSL). If ROE never hits 5% in 90 minutes, close.
- **Weak peak early cut:** If peak ROE was < 3% and ROE is now declining -> close after 45 minutes. Don't wait 90.
- **Dead weight:** SM conviction = 0, negative ROE, position open 30+ minutes -> instant cut regardless of phase.

**Why:** Phase 1 positions have no trailing stop protection. They're running on faith. If SM conviction doesn't materialize in 90 min, the thesis is wrong.

---

## Exit Rules

### 1. DSL v4 Mechanical Exit (Trailing Stops)

All trailing stops handled automatically by `dsl-combined.py` across all strategies.

### 2. SM Conviction Collapse
Conv drops to 0 or 4->1 with mass trader exodus -> instant cut.

### 3. Dead Weight
Conv 0, negative ROE, 30+ min -> instant cut.

### 4. SM Flip
Conviction 4+ in the OPPOSITE direction with 100+ traders -> cut immediately.

### 5. Race Condition Prevention
When ANY job closes a position -> immediately:
1. Set DSL state `active: false` in `state/{strategyKey}/dsl-{ASSET}.json`
2. Alert user
3. Evaluate: empty slot in that strategy for next signal?

**v6 note:** Since DSL is a combined runner iterating all strategies, no per-position crons to manage. Just set `active: false` in the state file.

---

## DSL v4 — Trailing Stop System

### Phase 1 (Pre-Tier 1): Absolute floor
- LONG floor = entry x (1 - 5%/leverage)
- SHORT floor = entry x (1 + 5%/leverage)
- 3 consecutive breaches -> close
- **Max duration: 90 minutes** (see Phase 1 Auto-Cut above)

### Phase 2 (Tier 1+): Trailing tiers

| Tier | ROE Trigger | Lock % of High-Water | Breaches to Close |
|------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 5% | 50% | 2 |
| 2 | 10% | 65% | 2 |
| 3 | 15% | 75% | 2 |
| 4 | 20% | 85% | 1 |

### Stagnation Take-Profit
Auto-close if ROE >= 8% and high-water stale for 1 hour.

### DSL State File
Each position gets `state/{strategyKey}/dsl-{ASSET}.json`. The combined runner iterates all active state files across all strategies. See `references/state-schema.md` for the full schema and critical gotchas (triggerPct not threshold, lockPct not retracePct, etc.).

---

## Opportunity Scanner v6

The v6 scanner addresses all reliability issues from the previous version:

| Fix | What Changed |
|-----|-------------|
| **BTC Macro Context** | Stage 0 analyzes BTC 4h+1h trend. Prevents alt longs during BTC crashes. |
| **Hourly Trend Filter** | `classify_hourly_trend()` analyzes swing structure. Counter-trend on hourly = hard skip. |
| **Hard Disqualifiers** | 6 conditions that skip assets entirely (not just penalize score). |
| **Parallel Fetches** | ThreadPoolExecutor for candle fetches (~20s vs ~60s). |
| **Cross-Scan Momentum** | `scoreDelta` and `scanStreak` from scan history. |
| **Configurable Thresholds** | Read from `history/scanner-config.json`. |
| **Per-TF Error Recovery** | One failed timeframe doesn't kill the asset. |
| **Position Awareness** | Checks ALL strategies' DSL states for conflicts. |
| **No Cold Start** | First scan produces baseline results immediately. |

### Hard Disqualifiers
1. Counter-trend on hourly (the "$346 lesson")
2. Extreme RSI (<20 shorts, >80 longs)
3. Counter-trend on 4h with strength >50
4. Volume dying (<0.5x on both timeframes)
5. Heavy unfavorable funding (>50% annualized)
6. BTC macro headwind >30 points

Disqualified assets appear in output with `reason` and `wouldHaveScored` for transparency.

---

## Rotation Rules

When slots are full in a strategy and a new FIRST_JUMP or IMMEDIATE fires:
- **Rotate if:** new signal is FIRST_JUMP or has 3+ reasons + positive velocity AND weakest position in that strategy is flat/negative ROE with SM conv 0-1
- **Hold if:** current position in Tier 2+ or trending up with SM conv 3+
- **Cross-strategy:** If one strategy is full but another has slots, route to the available strategy instead of rotating

---

## Budget Scaling

All sizing is calculated from budget (30% per slot):

| Budget | Slots | Margin/Slot | Leverage | Daily Loss Limit |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| $500 | 2 | $150 | 7x | -$75 |
| $2,000 | 2 | $600 | 10x | -$300 |
| $6,500 | 3 | $1,950 | 10x | -$975 |
| $10,000+ | 3-4 | $3,000 | 10x | -$1,500 |

**Minimum leverage: 7x.** If max leverage for an asset is below 7x, skip it. Low leverage = low ROE = DSL tiers never trigger = dead position.

**Auto-Delever:** If a strategy's account drops below its `autoDeleverThreshold` -> reduce max slots by 1, close weakest in that strategy.

---

## Position Lifecycle

### Opening
1. Signal fires -> validate checklist -> route to best-fit strategy
2. `create_position` on that strategy's wallet (use `leverageType: "ISOLATED"` for XYZ assets)
3. Create DSL state file in `state/{strategyKey}/dsl-{ASSET}.json` with `strategyKey` field
4. Alert user

### Closing
1. Close via `close_position` (or DSL auto-closes)
2. **Immediately** set DSL state `active: false`
3. Alert user with strategy name for context
4. Evaluate: empty slot in that strategy for next signal?

---

## Margin Types

- **Cross-margin** for crypto (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- **Isolated margin** for XYZ DEX (GOLD, SILVER, TSLA, etc.) — set `leverageType: "ISOLATED"` and `dex: "xyz"`
- Same wallet holds both cross crypto + isolated XYZ side by side

---

## XYZ Equities

XYZ DEX assets (GOLD, SILVER, TSLA, AAPL, etc.) behave differently:

- **Ignore trader count.** XYZ equities often have low SM trader counts — this doesn't invalidate the signal.
- **Use reason count + rank velocity** as primary quality filter instead.
- **Always use isolated margin** (`leverageType: "ISOLATED"`, `dex: "xyz"`).
- **Check max leverage** — many XYZ assets cap at 5x or 3x. If below 7x, skip.

---

## Token Optimization

- Skip redundant checks when data < 3 min old
- If all strategy slots full and no FIRST_JUMPs -> skip scanner processing
- If SM check shows no flips and < 5 min old -> skip

---

## Known Limitations

- **Watchdog blind spot for XYZ isolated:** The watchdog monitors cross-margin buffer but can't see isolated position liquidation distances in the same way. XYZ positions rely on DSL for protection.
- **Health check only sees crypto wallet:** The health check can't see XYZ positions for margin calculations. Total equity may differ.
- **Scanner needs history for momentum:** Cross-scan momentum (scoreDelta, scanStreak) requires at least 2 scans. First scan produces scored results immediately but without momentum data.

---

## Backward Compatibility

- `wolf_config.py` auto-migrates legacy `wolf-strategy.json` to registry format on first load
- Old `dsl-state-WOLF-*.json` files detected and migrated to `state/wolf-{id}/dsl-*.json`
- All scripts work with both layouts during transition
- Legacy `dsl-v4.py` still works for single-position use via `DSL_STATE_FILE` env var

---

## Troubleshooting

See `references/learnings.md` for known bugs, gotchas, and trading discipline rules. Key ones:
- **`dryRun: true` actually executes** — NEVER use dryRun
- **Max leverage varies per asset** — always check `max-leverage.json`
- **`close_position` is the close tool** — not `edit_position`
- **Tier 1 lock != guaranteed profit** — lock is from high-water, not entry

---
