  Opinionated trailing stop loss preset for Hyperliquid perps with tighter
  defaults than DSL v4. 4 tiers with per-tier breach counts that tighten as
  profit grows (3→2→2→1), auto-calculated price floors from entry and leverage,
  stagnation take-profit that closes if ROE ≥8% but high-water stalls for 1 hour.
  Same ROE-based engine as DSL v4 — different defaults, fewer knobs.
  Use when you want aggressive profit protection with minimal configuration.

  Requires python3, mcporter (configured with Senpi auth), and cron.
  Hyperliquid perp positions only.   Uses the same dsl engine as the dsl skill (scripts/dsl.py or dsl-v4.py).

# DSL-Tight — Opinionated Stop-Loss Preset

A tighter, more opinionated variant of DSL for aggressive profit protection. Same ROE-based engine as DSL v4 (`PnL / margin × 100`) — all tier triggers automatically account for leverage.

**Key difference from DSL v4:** DSL v4 is the configurable engine with maximum flexibility. DSL-Tight is the "just works" preset — fewer knobs, tighter defaults, per-tier breach counts, stagnation exits, and auto-calculated floors.

## Core Concept

All thresholds defined in ROE. The script auto-converts to price levels:
```
price_floor = entry × (1 ± lockPct / 100 / leverage)
```

## How It Works

### Phase 1 — Absolute Floor (Stop-Loss)
- 5% ROE trailing floor
- 3 consecutive breaches required
- Auto-calculated absolute floor from entry/leverage/retrace

### Phase 2 — Tiered Profit Lock
4 tiers that lock an increasing percentage of the high-water move:

| Tier | Trigger ROE | Lock % of HW Move | Breaches to Close |
|------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | 10% | 50% | 3 |
| 2 | 20% | 65% | 2 |
| 3 | 40% | 75% | 2 |
| 4 | 75% | 85% | 1 |

Per-tier breach counts tighten as profit grows — at Tier 4 (75% ROE), a single breach closes immediately.

### Stagnation Take-Profit
Auto-closes if:
- ROE ≥ 8% AND
- High-water mark hasn't improved for 1 hour

Catches winners that stall — takes the profit rather than waiting for a reversal.

## Breach Mechanics

- Hard decay only (breach count resets to 0 on recovery)
- Per-tier breach requirements (3→2→2→1) replace the global Phase 1/Phase 2 split
- Floor is always: `max(tier_floor, trailing_floor)` for LONG, `min()` for SHORT

### Field Reference

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `phase1.absoluteFloor` | **Not needed** — auto-calculated from entry, leverage, retrace |
| `tiers[].breachesRequired` | Per-tier breach count (replaces global phase2 setting) |
| `tiers[].retrace` | Per-tier trailing stop tightness |
| `stagnation.enabled` | Enable stagnation take-profit |
| `stagnation.minRoePct` | Minimum ROE to trigger stagnation check |
| `stagnation.maxStaleSec` | Max seconds HW can be stale before auto-close |

## Cron Setup

Same as DSL v4:
```
DSL_STATE_FILE=/data/workspace/dsl-tight-HYPE.json python3 scripts/dsl-v4.py
```

Every 3 minutes per position. Script location: `scripts/dsl-v4.py` (same script as DSL v4).

## Key Safety Features

- `CLOSE_NO_POSITION` graceful handling — if position already closed, deactivate cleanly
- Auto-calculated floors eliminate manual math errors
- Per-tier breach tightening means large profits get maximum protection
- Stagnation TP prevents stalled winners from reversing

## Example Walkthrough

10x LONG entry at $28.87:

1. **Phase 1**: Floor auto-calculated ~$28.73. Price rises, HW tracks.
2. **Tier 1 at 10% ROE** ($29.16): Floor locks at ~$29.01, 3 breaches to close.
3. **Tier 2 at 20% ROE** ($29.45): Floor locks at ~$29.24, now only 2 breaches.
4. **Stagnation**: Price stalls at 12% ROE for 65 min → auto-closed with profit.
5. **Tier 4 at 75% ROE** ($31.04): Floor at ~$30.71. Single breach = instant close.

## Script Location

Uses the same DSL engine from the `dsl` skill. Install the `dsl` skill first, then use this state file template for the tighter preset.
