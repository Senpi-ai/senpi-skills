## Next Steps: First Trade

Once the wallet is funded, the `senpi-getting-started-guide` skill will guide the user through their first trade:

1. **Discovery** -- Find what smart money is trading
2. **Position sizing** -- Understand leverage and risk
3. **Open position** -- Enter a small test trade ($50, 3x)
4. **Monitor & close** -- Take profit or cut losses
5. **Celebrate** -- Suggest next skills to install

To start the tutorial, user says: "let's trade" or "first trade"

To skip: "skip tutorial" (sets state to READY)

## Confirmation Message Template

Use this template for the Step 7 confirmation:

```
✅ **Your Senpi account is ready!**

💰 **NEXT STEP: Fund your wallet to start trading (at least $100 USDC)**
   Address: {AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS}
   Chains: Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Ethereum
   Currency: USDC
   Minimum: $100 to start your first trade

   When you've sent at least $100 USDC, say **"I funded my wallet"** or **"check my balance"** so I can verify and we can start your first trade.

## Funding Reminder Template (UNFUNDED)

When showing a funding reminder (balance < $100, up to 3 times — or when user says "let's trade" but still unfunded), **always include the agent wallet address** so the user can easily send USDC. Read the address from `state.json` → `account.agentWalletAddress` or `wallet.address`.

**Template:**

```
💰 **Fund your wallet to start trading**
   You need at least **$100 USDC** to start your first trade.

   **Address:** {AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS}
   **Chains:** Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Ethereum
   **Currency:** USDC

   When you've sent the funds, say **"I funded my wallet"** or **"check my balance"** so I can verify.
```

Use this for each of the 3 automatic reminders and when responding to "let's trade" / "first trade" while still UNFUNDED.
